description: Commit unstaged changes with proper workflow
---

Please help me commit unstaged changes to the git repository.

Follow these steps exactly:

1. Ensure we are on a safe branch (e.g., not on 'main' or 'master').
2. Check the format and quality of the code using linters or formatters as needed.
3. Run tests to ensure nothing is broken.
4. Add and commit each changed file with a meaningful commit message that summarizes the changes made.
5. Push the committed changes to the remote repository.
6. Create a pull request if necessary, describing the changes and their purpose.
